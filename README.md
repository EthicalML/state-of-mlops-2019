* About: Alejandro is the Chief Scientist at the Institute for Ethical AI & Machine Learning, where he leads highly technical research on machine learning explainability, bias evaluation, reproducibility and responsible design. With over 10 years of software development experience, Alejandro has held technical leadership positions across hyper-growth scale-ups and tech giants including Eigen Tchnologies, Bloomberg LP and Hack Partners. He has a strong track record building departments of machine learning engineers from scratch, and leading the delivery of large-scale machine learning system across the financial, insurance, legal, transport, manufacturing and construction sectors (in Europe, US and Latin America).

## About The Institute for Ethical AI & Machine Learning
We are a research centre based in the UK led by a group of machine learning researchers and engineers, and supported by our large set of cross functional members (ethicists, philosophers, psychologists, experts and policy-makers). We carry out highly technical and cross-functional research to answer some of the most challenging questions present in the intersection of AI / Machine Learning and industry from both a strategic and hands-on perspective.
